# Shortest-Route-System
The primary goal of this project is to develop a Shortest Route System that can suggest the fastest and most efficient route between two locations in a city by using Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm on a road network. The road network is represented as a graph, where roads and intersections act as edges and nodes. The project uses OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, accessed via the OSMNx Python library, to build this network for a specific city such as Delhi or Bangalore.
As a result, the system can calculate the shortest or fastest route not just by distance but also by the traffic conditions.
The final output is an interactive route visualization using Folium, which shows the recommended path on a map. This system demonstrates how combining open-source mapping tools with graph algorithms can help reduce traffic congestion, save travel time, and improve overall urban mobility.
